# Usage

## Decryption

The decryption script expects two arguments, 1. the file path and 2, the password. The output is written into the standard out, and can be piped into a file.

## Conversion

The format conversion script takes one mandatory argument, the input file path. The output is again written to `stdout` and can be redirected.
